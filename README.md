# Badgelife SAO Debug Tool for Flipper Zero

This is a relatively simple expansion board for the Flipper Zero, that has the proper connectors to attach SAOs and communicate with the SAO via I2C and the GPIO pins.

It can also be used to communicate with a badge, essentially making the Flipper Zero into an SAO, electrically, which could be usefull for debugging or developing communication between badge as SAOs.
